# STRANGE

**STRANGE** \(Similarity TRacker in Academia with Natural lanGuage Explanation\) is a tool for observing similarities and the surface differences among Java/Python source code files. For Python,  the compiler needs to be installed and the absolute path should be set in 'pythoncompilerpath.txt'. Further details can be seen in [the corresponding paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3073703) published on IEEE Access. You can see this guideline in Indonesian below.

## STRANGE Modes 
## 1. Pair observation
This mode captures the similarities shared between two given source code files and stores them as an interactive HTML page. This mode can be embedded when developing other similarity detection software.
*Quick execution command*:
```
pair <codepath1> <codepath2> <programming_language> <target_html_filepath>
```
*Complete execution command*: 
```
pair <codepath1> <codepath2> <programming_language> <target_html_filepath> <projectname1> <projectname2> <home_filepath> <syntax_minimum_match_length> <additional_keywords_path>
```
## 2. Assignment comparison
This mode pairwise compares student code files for an assignment and shows the similarities in interactive HTML pages. It accepts an assignment directory with each sub-directory represents a student submission containing one code file. The results are stored as a directory with 'index.html' as the entry page. Please preprocess the assignment directory with mode 4 if the assignment is broken down to sub-assignments, or with mode 5 if the assignment requires more than one code file per submission.
*Quick execution command*: 
```
comp <assignment_root_dirpath> <programming_language> <target_html_dirpath>
```
*Complete execution command*: 
```
comp <assignment_root_dirpath> <programming_language> <target_html_dirpath> <sim_threshold> <syntax_minimum_match_length> <additional_keywords_path>
```
## 3. JPlag result update
This mode upgrades JPlag-style HTML pages for similarity observation with the ones from STRANGE. It accepts a JPlag-generated directory and an assignment directory with each sub-directory represents a student submission containing one file. Each of the HTML pages will be replaced with the STRANGE-style ones.
*Quick execution command*: 
```
jplag <jplag_root_dirpath> <assignment_root_dirpath> <programming_language>
```
*Complete execution command*: 
```
jplag <jplag_root_dirpath> <assignment_root_dirpath> <programming_language> <syntax_minimum_match_length> <additional_keywords_path>
```
## 4. Assignment code grouping
This mode groups student submissions based on their sub-assignments' filename patterns. It accepts an assignment directory with each sub-directory represents a student submission containing several code files, and then group the code files based on the sub-assignments' filename patterns. The results will be stored in a directory named '\[grouped\]' + assignment directory name. Each sub-assignment will be represented as one sub-directory in which the name is based on the pattern but with only alphanumerics. Those that do not share one of the given file name pattern will be grouped as 'uncategorised'.
*Execution command*: 
```
group <assignment_root_dirpath> <programming_language> <name_pattern_1> <name_pattern_2> ... <name_pattern_N> 
```
## 5. Assignment code file merging: this mode merges all code files in each student submission.
   It accepts an assignment directory containing students projects as the sub-directories, and
   then merge each project's code files as one large code file. The results will be stored in a
   directory named '[merged]' + assignment directory name, where each sub-directory represents
   one student project.
   -> Execution command: merge <assignment_root_dirpath> <programming_language>
6. Template code removal: this mode removes template code from all code files in an assignment
   directory. It accepts an assignment directory and a template code file. The results will be
   stored in a directory named '[template removed]' + assignment directory name, where the
   directory structure is similar to the given assignment directory, except that only processed
   code files are copied. The removed template code will be informed per code file as comments.
   Template code is detected with a greedy algorithm and it is not guarantee to be completely
   accurate (despite it is still acceptable).
   -> Execution command: template <assignment_root_dirpath> <programming_language>
        <template_path>

## Parameters description \(sorted alphabetically\):  
### <additional_keywords_path>
A string representing a file containing additional keywords with newline as the delimiter. Keywords with more than one token should be written by embedding spaces between the tokens. For example, 'System.out.print' should be written as \'System . out . print\'. If unused, please set this to \'null\'.  
### <common_code_filepath>
A string representing a file containing common code segments. The file can be either the mode 1's output or an arbitrary code written in compliance to the programming language's syntax.
### <common_code_type>
A string that should be either 'code', 'codegeneralised', or 'complete'. The first one means the common code file is a regular code file. The second one is similar to the first except that the code tokens will be generalised prior compared for exclusion. The third one means the common code file is the mode 1's output without 'coderesult' parameter.
### <input_dirpath>
A string representing the input directory containing student submissions (each submission is represented by either one file or one sub-directory). Please use quotes if the path contains spaces.
### <inclusion_threshold>
A floating number representing the minimum percentage threshold for common segment inclusion. Any segments which submission occurrence proportion is higher than or equal to the threshold are included. This is assigned with 0.75 by default; all segments that occur in more than or equal to three fourths of the submissions are included.  
Value: a floating number between 0 to 1 (inclusive).
### <max_ngram_length>
A number depicting the largest n-gram length of the filtered common segments. This is assigned 50 by default.  
Value: a positive integer higher than <min_ngram_length>.
### <min_ngram_length>
A number depicting the smallest n-gram length of the filtered common segments. This is assigned 10 by default.  
Value: a positive integer.
### <output_filepath>
A string representing the filepath of the output, containing the common segments. Please use quotes if the path contains spaces.
### <programming_language>
A constant depicting the programming language used on given student submissions.  
Value: 'java' (for Java) or 'py' (for Python).
### 'coderesult'
This ensures the suggested segments are displayed as raw code instead of generalised while having no information about the variation. The segments can be passed directly to a code similarity detection tool for exclusion. It is set true by default.
### 'generalised'
This enables token generalisation while selection common segments. It is set true by default. See the paper for details.
### 'lineexclusive'
This ensures the common segment selection only considers segments that start at the beginning of a line and end at the end of a line. It is set as true by default. See the paper for details.
### 'startident'
This ensures the common segment selection only considers segments that start with identifier or keyword. It is set true by default. See the paper for details.
### 'subremove'
This removes any common segments that are a part of longer fragments from the result. It is set true by default. See the paper for details.
